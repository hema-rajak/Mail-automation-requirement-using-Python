# Mail-automation-requirement-using-Python
this utility is providing automation of any Mail sent to the user. We will have a list of Mails and Subjects present in the sheet. We need to build a python based utility which will take input of sheet data and it will automatically send mail to that list of mail mentioned in the sheet.

Email Id and Subjects need to be provided in the sheet. The rest of the information is fixed like the Mail message body and attachment is the same for all the mails.

At the end we will have a response sheet where we need to mention mail id with status of Mail delivery (eg Sent successfully, Failed, Pending etc.)
